d20-druid-shape
===============

Calculate a Druid's wild shape statistics from various sources!

The goal is to allow players and GMs to load HeroForge saved
druids and choose from a list of wild shapes. While I'd like to
support as many of the 3.5e sources as I can, I'm starting with
the d20 SRD open content for both simplicity and avoidance of
legal issues.

Questions I Wish Were Frequently Asked:
* Why Java?
Because Java is cross-platform, I had just found the Apache POI
library for parsing Excel files, and I'm familiar with the language.
